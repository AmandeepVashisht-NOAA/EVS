Instruction for tesing EVS global_ens plotting package:

 General information

  The EVS global_ens plotting package has 2 parts: 
     (1) For global_ens: compare GEFS, CMCE and ECME scores 
     (2) For NAEFS: compare NAEFS, GEFS and CMCE
     (3) For GEFS haedline score: compare GEFS, NAEFS and GFS score 

  
1. Testing procedure:
  All testing ecf scripts in the directory:
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/${USER}/EVS/ecf/global_ens.dev
 (1) For global_ens plotting:
    For 31 day average score, there are following 9 ecf files 
       jevs_gefs_grid2grid_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_grid2obs_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_grid2obs_past31days_init_separate_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile1_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile2_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile3_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile4_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_sea_ice_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_precip_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_snowfall_past31days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_sst_past31days_plots.ecf
    For 90 day average score, there are following 9 ecf files
       jevs_gefs_grid2grid_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_grid2obs_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_grid2obs_past90days_init_separate_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile1_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile2_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile3_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_profile4_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_sea_ice_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_precip_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_snowfall_past90days_plots.ecf
       jevs_gefs_sst_past90days_plots.ecf

 (2) For NAEFS plotting:
    For 31 day average score, there are following 3 ecf files
      jevs_naefs_grid2grid_past31days_plots.ecf
      jevs_naefs_grid2obs_past31days_plots.ecf
      jevs_naefs_precip_past31days_plots.ecf
    For 90 day average score, there are following 3 ecf files
      jevs_naefs_grid2grid_past90days_plots.ecf
      jevs_naefs_grid2obs_past90days_plots.ecf
      jevs_naefs_precip_past90days_plots.ecf

  (3) For GEFS spatial map
      jevs_gefs_precip_spatial_plots.ecf

  (4) For GEFS headline plotting
      jevs_global_ens_headline_plots.ecf
  

Note: (1) Both global_ens and NAEFS plotting ecf scripts are run once per day
          The headline ecf script is run once per YEAR!
      (2) The plotting package depends on the EVS stat files located in 
         /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/com/evs/v1.0/stats/global_ens
         gefs.yyyymmdd,  cmce.yyyymmdd,  ecme.yyyymmdd,  naefs.yyyymmdd and gfs.yyyymmdd 
      For 31 day average, at least required past 31 days of stat files
      For 90 day average, at least required past 90 days of stat files 

The submission of all above ecf jobs can be done by running the script submit_all_plots.sh 
  in the same ecf dev directory

The submission of headline job can be done by 
qsub jevs_global_ens_headline_plots.ecf

2. For each job, the running output (o and e) files will be stored in the ecf dev directory 
  /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/${USER}/EVS/ecf/global_ens.dev

3. The Working directory
   The working directories of all jobs are in /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/$USER/evs/tmpnwprd   

4. All plots for each job will be tarred in the tar files in the directory
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/com/evs/v1.0/plots/atmos/$VDATE
