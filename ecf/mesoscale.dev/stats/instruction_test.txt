Testing ecf directory:
  /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/evs.v1.0/ecf/mesoscale.dev/stats

  There are 2 ecf files:
   jevs_sref_grid2obs_stats.ecf
   jevs_sref_precip_stats.ecf
 
   Tese 2 ecj jobs have no relationship. They can be qsub at same time


Submit jobs:

  qsub jevs_sref_grid2obs_stats.ecf
  qsub jevs_sref_precip_stats.ecf 

  Note: since "#PBS -j oe" is set, the stdout file will be in the submit directory
   /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/$USER/EVS/evs.v1.0/ecf/mesoscale.dev/stats

The running directory (i.e. $DATA) will be in /lfs/h2/emc/ptmp/${USER}/evs/tmpnwprd:
  
  evs_sref_grid2obs_stats.$jobid
  evs_sref_precip_stats.$jobid

  jobid is automatically created ($$) during the run

The running has 3 stages for each job

 (1) Run METplus to process PB2NC prepbufr files (grid2obs) or PCP_Combine 6hr CCPA  data and sref's 6h APCP data files (precip)

       After finished, 
     the prepbufr files are in  $DATE/prepbufr.vdate sub-directory  
     the pcp_combine files are in $DATA/ccpa.vdate, sref.initdate1, sref.initdate2, sref.initdate3, sref.initdate4, and sref.initdate5
     Since there will be 5 days and 26 sref member's 6hr APCP should be generated, it takes a while to complete this work 

 (2) Run METplus to generate stat files
 
     For grid2obs 
       All of output stat files will be in the $DATA/grid2obs
     For precip 
       All of output stat files will be in  the $DATA/precip

     After the stage (1) is finished, 

        for grid2obe following 2 sub-job scripts are generated for MPI run
           run_sref_g2o_CONUS.prepbufr.fhr1.sh
           run_sref_g2o_CONUS.prepbufr.fhr2.sh

        for precip following 2 sub-job scripts are generated for MPI run
           run_sref_mpi_CONUS.ccpa.fhr1.sh
           run_sref_mpi_CONUS.ccpa.fhr2.sh

    The METplus output_base for each sub-jobs are in grid2obs or precip
        

    In each job's output_base directory, there are 3 sub directories
          logs, stats, and tmp
       
    The small stat files are stored in the stats. For grid2obs and precip , the small stat files have 3 types:
          (1) ensemble_stat*.stat
          (2) point_stat*MEAN*.stat (grid2obs) or grid_stat*MEAN*.stat (precip)
          (3) point_stat*PROB*.stat (grid2obs) or grid_stat*PROB*.stat (precip)

 (3) Combine the small stat files to a large stat file

     After the small stat files of all of grid2obs or precip ijobs are created, they will be copied to 
    the directory 
       /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/${USER}/com/evs/v1.0/stats/narre/atmos.$VDATE

   Thes small stat files  are then combined (by StatAnalysis tool) into a large stat file
   called NARRE_MEAN_grid2obs_20221002.stat
   This large stat file is stored in the directory 
      /lfs/h2/emc/vpppg/noscrub/binbin.zhou/com/evs/v1.0/stats/narre.$VDATE

  The StatAnalysis METplus output_base directory is $DATA/gather, in which all of running info are stored
